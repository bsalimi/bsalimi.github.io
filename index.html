<h1>Research Interest</h1>
<p>My research interests focus on advancing the field of trustworthy data analysis by fostering responsible data management practices. I am deeply passionate about data management, as I believe that having reliable, accessible, and well-organized data is crucial for establishing trust in data-driven decision-making. My research aims to create methods that promote transparency, fairness, reliability, and robustness in algorithmic decision-making processes. By adopting a data management-centric approach, I strive to develop tools and techniques that empower human decision-makers to interpret data more accurately and confidently.
In my research group, we are committed to creating tools that support decision-makers from diverse backgrounds in understanding data and making more informed choices. Our goal is to enable better decision-making by bridging the gap between complex data and human understanding, ultimately fostering trust in data analysis.
